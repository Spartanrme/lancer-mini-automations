# LANCER Mini Automations

These are mini automations I've implemented in my own Lancer games, packaged in a module for ease of use and updating.

Big credit to the PILOT.NET Discord and csmcfarland's Lancer QoL, which helped make this module possible.

This is still very much a work in progress, so if you somehow have come across this and want to use it, please feel free and reach out if you have any questions!
